Asteroids Runner
================

This is an HTML5 game created to see how far I can push the platform, and as an exercise in creating a simple game with very small scope, hopefully for eventual release. It packages smoothly for iOS with the Ejecta framework which simulates an HTML 5 <canvas> in Objective-C (it interprets all the Javascript).

The engine used is ImpactJS, which is closed-source: you won't get anywhere just downloading the source code here unless you also own a license for ImpactJS and drop in the \impact directory.
